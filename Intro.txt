Intro

I suppose a good way to keep track of this is to create a txt file for each step in creating our beloved soda can.

This is the intro. 

So far the sections include:

~A digital doll of Skippy
~A lottery number generator
~A dialogue deal for him 
~A feature that allows him LOOSE interpretation of your actions
~An accessible Menu probably at his center to select features
~A "rest" mode where he sits as a soda can in the corner of your screen
~An opening animation sequence between his "rest" mode and the reactive doll
~An inspirational quote library with random and triggerable features
~A fake stock market generator with faux languages
~A playable minigame feature akin to Galaxiga or Space Invaders
