# Skippy-the-Magnificent
My husband has been listening to this audiobook, Expeditionary Force, and I LOVE this character. I'd like to make a basic little. Well, "clippy" like thing for desktop that acts like Skippy. His entire concept is so fascinating to me
Gotta love an unattainable goal right?

What an awesome day to be alive!
I emailed Craig Alanson, the creator of Skippy, and got explicit permission to use him as a concept in this project :)
Apparently, Craig used to code in C++ and SQL, THIS IS GOING TO BE SO FUN!

Now that I have that out of the way, I can brainstorm some ideas on components necessary to make Skippy

1. A digital doll of sorts, I have been working on some Skippy Inspired pixel art, would need to make it more like a doll and make a program that calls images to depict mannerisms like being angry, being smug, being insulted. He's so fun!

2. A lottery number generator (fake of course, not actually tied to the system but a fun and maybe even useful tool in his repituoir
3. I want him to call the user Joe. I want him to insist on it, and make it a point of contention, using his best phrases like "I could go to the tried and true and call you a stupid monkey"
4. I want him to interact with and judge your content. For security reasons this would need to be loose. It would be like "When the user opens chrome"  he rolls his eyes, turns around and peeks.
5. I want him to be clickable and have a menu of things you can interact with him with.
6. When not in use he sits as a soda can on the corner of your screen
7. When activated, his head lights up like a hologram and his fancy hat shows up
8. I want him to have a repitour of smartass inspirational quotes, perhaps some he's altered and some that are intentionally ridiculous
9. I wwant him to give you the stocks of Skippy Stan in an alien language. "FNDSNGFOINWOIA up 4% today!"
10. Maybe he can even have a game in his menu, where it opens and you play something like a simple Galaxiga, where you can see the flying dutchman as your movable ship, and the villians can be like the Jeraptha


I am open to people adding themselves to this project, but you need to leave detailed explainations as to what you did and why, like REALLY dumbed down, I am a newer student at this and this project is meant to really flesh out my skills over time. 

If you have any suggestions, let me know! I'd be happy to add some challenges to this, it's kinda the whole point
