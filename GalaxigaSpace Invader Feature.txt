Galaxiga/Space Invader Feature

Feels like a safe place to start since I can use what I already know and build on it instead of fully learning an entirely new skill to create it. 

First things first, according to my research, is that I need to learn to create an API that the minigame can run on. I am not expecting to be too flashy, my coding skills are in their infancy, but it will be fun to build! 

After some deliberation, and to keep it from getting too heavy, I think using Phaser would be my best option, allowing Skippy's menu to launch the game directly to the desktop or browser. It should also allow it to be cross-platform between Windows, Mac and Linux OS

Just did about an hour on it, its a little complex but should be easy to tinker with over time
